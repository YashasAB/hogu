The error you're encountering is related to TypeScript expecting a ReactNode type but encountering a void type in your JSX. Specifically, it's happening when trying to conditionally render the <section> element based on the user value.
Fix Overview:
The issue stems from the conditional rendering in your JSX, where TypeScript expects a ReactNode, but the value returned from the ternary expression (null in this case) is not being handled correctly.
Steps to Fix the Build Error:
Check the Type of user:
You are using user in a conditional block, but TypeScript might not have inferred its type correctly in this context. You should ensure that user is of type User | null, as you've defined it in your state.
Refactor the Conditional Rendering:
In your Home.tsx file, modify the user check and ensure that the ternary operation returns a valid ReactNode (or null).
{user ? (
  <section className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-blue-50 rounded-2xl p-6">
    {/* Your content here */}
  </section>
) : null}
Make sure that null is explicitly set to return a valid JSX element. In TypeScript, null is a valid JSX return type, but if TypeScript still complains, try wrapping it with a valid element or returning undefined explicitly in the false condition.
Explicitly Define the Return Type:
If the issue persists, you can explicitly define the return type of the JSX expression, especially for the ternary check.
{user ? (
  <section className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-blue-50 rounded-2xl p-6">
    {/* Your content */}
  </section>
) : (
  <></>  // Explicitly return an empty React fragment to ensure the return type is valid
)}
Recheck useState and Type Definitions:
Ensure your user state is correctly defined as:
const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
Summary:
The error arises because TypeScript expects the ternary condition to return a valid ReactNode. In this case, null should be valid, but explicitly returning an empty fragment (<></>) or refactoring the conditional logic should resolve the issue.
Try making these changes and rebuilding. If this doesn't resolve the issue, please provide more context about the error, such as whether it occurs only during certain actions or persistently.
