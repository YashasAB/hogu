Issue Explanation:
In your current code:
{user ? (
  <section className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-blue-50 rounded-2xl p-6">
    {/* Your content here */}
  </section>
) : null}
The null return here should be valid in JSX, but TypeScript is likely confused due to how user is handled. The void issue arises because, in some cases, the ternary operator or the user check might not be returning a valid ReactNode.
Potential Causes:
Type inference issue: If TypeScript is unable to infer the return type correctly in certain conditional cases (e.g., null is inferred incorrectly), it may generate this error.
State type mismatch: The useState hook has been typed as User | null, but if user is being treated as undefined somewhere else, TypeScript might get confused.
Solution:
You can resolve the issue by ensuring that user is treated properly and explicitly returning a ReactNode in all cases:
Refactor the conditional rendering:
Instead of using &&, use a ternary operator or explicit return to ensure null is handled correctly.
{user ? (
  <section className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-blue-50 rounded-2xl p-6">
    {/* Your content here */}
  </section>
) : (
  // You can explicitly return `null` or another JSX element here
  null
)}
The key difference is the explicit ternary operator (? :), which ensures TypeScript always returns either the section element or null, and null is a valid ReactNode.
Verify the state initialization:
Ensure that user is correctly initialized as null and is being set correctly.
const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
Add undefined check if needed:
If there is any possibility that user might be undefined, TypeScript will fail to recognize it as null. In this case, you can add an explicit check for undefined.
{user !== null && user !== undefined ? (
  <section className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-blue-50 rounded-2xl p-6">
    {/* Your content here */}
  </section>
) : null}
This ensures that user is always checked against both null and undefined.
Conclusion:
The most likely fix is to explicitly return null in the ternary operator instead of relying on &&. This should resolve the TypeScript error. Let me know if this works or if you need further assistance!
